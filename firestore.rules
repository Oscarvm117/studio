/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Biotrazo Marketplace.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, reflecting the application's user-centric design.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/farmer_dashboard: Stores farmer dashboard data. Only the farmer can read/write their own dashboard data.
 * - /users/{userId}/lots/{lotId}: Stores lot data for each farmer. Only the farmer can read/write their own lots.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed.
 * - The rules prioritize simplicity and security by leveraging path-based ownership and avoiding complex queries or external data lookups.
 * - A collection group query on 'lots' is allowed for buyers to browse all available products.
